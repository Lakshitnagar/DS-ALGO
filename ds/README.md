# Data Structures

Here is the list (with implementation) of popular data structures.

## [Linked List](https://github.com/Lakshitnagar/DS-ALGO/tree/master/ds/linkedlist)
Linked List is a data structure whose data unlike arrays are not stored in continuous fashion in the memory, instead spread across the memory and each data linked with a `next` variable inside it which tells where the next data is lying.  

## [Stack](https://github.com/Lakshitnagar/DS-ALGO/tree/master/ds/stack)
Stack is a CD-holder like structure in which pushing the data creates a pile or stack. Retrieving is restricted to last element pushed. It follows LIFO.  

## [Queue](https://github.com/Lakshitnagar/DS-ALGO/tree/master/ds/queue)
Queue follow first come first serve policy, FIFO. Retrieving is restricted to first element pushed.

## [Generic Tree](https://github.com/Lakshitnagar/DS-ALGO/tree/master/ds/genericTree)
Same as linked list, but instead of one child it can have any number of children.
